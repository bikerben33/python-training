## About This Repository

This repository is dedicated to my Python learning journey. 

## Projects

### Project 1: [Training]
**Description**: The training exercises are in the root directory.

### Project 2: [What to Watch App]
**Description**: As I learn each new function, I repeat it in my application that I am building. The purpose 
of the application is to prioritize and filter shows and movies I want to watch, based on what service
they are on.
